# Data2_Project
Repository for the final project of Data and Programming for Public Policy 2 - Python

Motivation

Researchers from various branches – sociology, political science, and economics – have attempted to assess the root of crime from different angles. This project aims to establish correlations between educational attainment and criminal activity across community areas of Chicago. We recognize that crime depends on multiple factors such as number of policemen, or social services such as education, employment opportunities or even entertainment, but the scope of this project focuses only on education variables. So, a significant relationship between education and crime would be useful to design effective public policies based on micro data, i.e: increase the efforts where the education performance is not good and the crime rates are high.

The specific questions to address are: what is the relationship between number of schools and crime by community area? Does the normalization matter? What variables of education quality and attendance should be included? The project involves two challenges: a) Data arrangements: collecting diverse sources, merging relevant data and retrieving data from public webpages. b) Statistical Models: Fitting a traditional linear regressions, predicting categorical variables relacionadas con el crimen using machine learning and visualizing some results in an interesting way.
