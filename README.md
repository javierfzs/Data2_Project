Education and Crime in Chicago: A micro-level approach

Motivation

Researchers from various branches – sociology, political science, and economics – have attempted to assess the root of crime from different angles. This project aims to establish correlations between educational attainment and criminal activity across community areas of Chicago. We recognize that crime depends on multiple factors such as number of policemen, or social services such as education, employment opportunities or even entertainment, but the scope of this project focuses only on education variables. So, a significant relationship between education and crime would be useful to design effective public policies based on micro data, i.e: increase the efforts where the education performance is not good and the crime rates are high.

The specific questions to address are: Is there any significant relationship between education variables and crime by community area? Does the normalization by populations matter? What variables of education quality and attendance should be included? The project involves two challenges: a) Data arrangements: collecting diverse sources, merging relevant data and retrieving data using web scarping. b) Statistical Models: Fitting a traditional linear regressions, predicting categorical variables related with crime using machine learning and visualizing some results in an interesting way.
